This is a web project me and a classmate made. its using express and the socket IO JS library to allow two opponents
to go against eachother in a game of go bang over network as long as the hosted computers address is shared.

NOTE:
this was made using XAMPP and should be placed within the 'htdocs' folder.
and the exported database is included as 'coolChat.sql'
